DOING
------
- create a new project on edit if the folder does not exists: can I "set it on the main parameters" and handle that
  in the edit window? Can I accept editing without a folder then show a window to create a new project or open an existing one?

TODO
-----
- command line arguments could be run or edit, then the others are options: -project -job -ui, so:
  - to run a job: `jobsui run -project <pathtoproject> -job <jobid>`
  - to edit a project: `jobsui edit -project <pathtoproject>`
  - to open the main application: `jobsui`
- project's version must be mandatory on save
- when I save a project, I must save the previous project, then restore it if something goes wrong
- when I import an external project is name needed?
- rename key to id
- CallXML has no matching class JobCall
- ExpressionXML and CallXML as ParameterXML
  is it needed?
   returns both
- EditProject: the call to JobXML.getParameter is needed? Can I call a specific method for parameter, expression and call?

DONE
-----
- refactoring and testing JobsUIParameters
