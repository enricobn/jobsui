- customizable UIComponentType
- JobDependency and JobDependencyXML are correct names?
- warning on closing project editing with changes
- why getScriptsLocations() and not getScriptLocation? Do I need more than one location different from "scripts"?
- when I create a new project and add it to the last opened project registry, I must, eventually, update the main window
- validate expressions and calls on edit
- command line arguments could be new, run or edit, then the others are options: -project -job -ui, so:
  - to create a new job: `jobsui new` (is it needed?, It can be easily done in the main application)
  - to run a job: `jobsui run -project <pathtoproject> -job <jobid>`
  - to edit a project: `jobsui edit -project <pathtoproject>`
  - to open the main application: `jobsui`
- project's version must be mandatory on save
- when I import an external project is name needed?
- rename key to id
- CallXML has no matching class JobCall
- ExpressionXML and CallXML as ParameterXML
  is it needed?
   returns both
- EditProject: the call to JobXML.getParameter is needed? Can I call a specific method for parameter, expression and call?
- JobsUIPreferencesImpl why save every time all?
- history of run
